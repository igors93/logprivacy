    Adapters are intended for application classes, external library types, and

    (``str``, ``int``, ``dict``, ``list``, etc.) are reserved and cannot be
    registered.  A custom subclass such as ``class ExternalList(list)`` *can*
    be registered; ``list`` itself cannot.

    Adapter dispatch for custom subclasses happens **before** the built-in
    structural handlers (Mapping, list/tuple, set/frozenset), so a registered
    converter always takes precedence over the native fallback.

    ``default()`` returns a fresh registry so applications and tests can add
    converters without mutating shared global state.
