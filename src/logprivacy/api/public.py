    Return a stdlib logger protected by ``LogPrivacyFilter``.

    The logger's own records are cleaned directly. Filters scoped to its
    namespace are also installed on every currently configured handler in the
    propagation chain, protecting child loggers such as ``app.http`` while
    leaving unrelated logger namespaces unchanged.

    Call this function after configuring logging handlers. Calling it again is
    safe and refreshes handler protection. A second call without an explicit
    ``policy`` reuses the existing cleaner; an explicit policy replaces it.
    By default, blocked records are replaced with a non-sensitive audit marker.
    ``drop_blocked=True`` preserves the legacy discard behavior, while
    ``drop_blocked=False`` raises ``LogBlockedError``.
